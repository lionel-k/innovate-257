## Who are we ?

## Why do we do what we do ?
We believe in empowering a Burundian youth that will take responsibility for the development of their country.

## How do we want to proceed ?
* Highlight the achievement of our members (diaspora and local) to inspire the members
* Create a space where the members can submit articles for the development of the youth
* Forum space on our website or Facebook (a little bit like Hackathon hacker), pretty much a community that provides mutual help to its members on youth related matters.
* Sponsor members’ projects.
* Encourage the creation of small businesses by providing the mentorship, the connections and the finances.
* Create a pride of being part of the Innovate 257 movement. Membership is free but you must be an active member to maintain your place and have access to our resources. (Points for participation, weekly ranking, showcase the ranking and top participants)
* Support promising but low income students since elementary school up to high school graduation.
* Ambassadors of the organization (education, mentorship, … )
* Monthly member, highlight their achievement.
* Special effort to empower young women.
* Empower promising Social Entrepreneurs
* Orient the students depending on their interest.
* Newsletter for Innovate 257, short articles ( Medium, not necessarily Burundians,...), tips, advices for inspiration.
* Create Innovate 257 clubs in high schools to reach the most students and coordinate with the leads.

## What is this platform all about ?
This platform is mainly for education access, mentorship, personal development, career prep, and a carrefour for opportunities destined for Burundian students and young professionals.
