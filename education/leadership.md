## [Young African Leaders Initiative \(YALI\)](https://yali.state.gov/)

{% hint style="info" %}
The Young African Leaders Initiative \(YALI\) is a signature effort to invest in the next generation of African leaders. Nearly 1 in 3 Africans are between the ages of 10 and 24, and approximately 60 percent of Africaâ€™s total population is below the age of 35. Former President Obama launched YALI in 2010 to support young African leaders as they spur growth and prosperity, strengthen democratic governance, and enhance peace and security across Sub-Saharan Africa.

The Young African Leaders Initiative, or YALI, is not just a fellowship, or an online community, or a place to go for regional leadership training. YALI is all three!
