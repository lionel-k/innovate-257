{% hint style="info" %}
diversitytickets.org is a Travis Foundation app which helps conference organisers who have partnered with us reach out to minority groups by offering them ticket and travel grants. They can do so by adding their own event/conference and specifying how many tickets will be given away. Once the event is approved, it becomes publicly listed on the website and applicants can apply for it.
